## Introduction
In this repository, you will find a collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms in C. Each implementation is designed to provide a clear and concise example of the respective data structure or algorithm, along with necessary helper functions and usage examples. The primary motivation behind creating this repository was to delve deeper into C programming and enhance my proficiency in the language.

## Features
TO DO!

## Installation
TO DO!

## Usage
Each data structure or algorithm is implemented in a separate C file, accompanied by a header file (.h) that contains the necessary function prototypes and definitions.

The general structure looks like the following:

```
Topic/
├── include
│   └── Topic.h
├── Makefile
└── src
    ├── main.c
    └── Topic.c
```
